# NUMPY

Multi-dimensional arrays library.

List are slow, Numpy arrays are fast.

Numpy uses fixed types. Like Int32, Int16, float32, Int8 ( single bite ).

When we iterate through this array, we don't have to type check everytime.

Numpy is contiguous memory. CPU have Single instruction Multiple data processing units which make numpy computational fast. Also, cache is more effectively utilized. Also, Numpy have more functionality than Lists like multiply, matrix multiplications and other computational stuff.

List is a contiguous array of pointers not of the various data-types.

Applications of Numpy :
- Have lot of Matlab functions. If Numpy doesn't work use scipy.
- Useful for Plotting ( Matplotlib ).
- Backend of many other frameworks ( Pandas, Digital Photography ).
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
